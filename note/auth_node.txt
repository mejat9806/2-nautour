//! IMPORTANT NEVER save password in plain text need incription 
use brypt 

//!how JWT token work 
is a stateless solution for authentication basically it did not work stored session state in server

step by step of JWT (need HTTPS)

1 user create a new login request with password and email 
2 server will create a unique jwt token (a string) if it is correct
3 server will send it to client and it will be saved in as a cookie or localstorage
4 next when client get its JWT token it will use that token to access protected routes like profile page by sending it to the server like showing a password to the imigration officer
5 next server will verify the jwt token and if the request is correct it will send the data back to the client

//!protector route
lock our route behind a JWT token and only let verify the jwt token to enter the route
JWT token usually send by the header with key autorization and value :"Bearer JWT token"
